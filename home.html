        Welcome to my website about Robotic vacuum cleaners
    </h1>
   <p> A cleaning robot is a circle robot that has a limit cleaning time before the battery is dead. A robotic vacuum cleaner, sometimes called a robovac or a roomba as a generic trademark, is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner which has a limited vacuum floor cleaning system combined with sensors and robotic drives with programmable controllers and cleaning routines.

    What input does the cleaning robot have?
   </h2> 
   <p>What sensors does a cleaning robot have?
   Because of this, cliff sensors are a safety requirement on all robot vacuums. They measure the distance to the floor by constantly sending infrared signals to its surface. If the signals don't immediately bounce back, the robot surmises it has reached a stair or some other “cliff” and will change direction.

   <h3>
    Why is it named Robotic vacuum cleaner?
    </h3>
    <p>The definition of the desired functions and the design of an ultimate versatile personal robot is an ongoing debate. Meanwhile, however, precursors of this yet to evolve species are well on their way to become commercial products. Cleaning robots for public environments as well as for private households seem to be able to provide the breakthrough which the designers of non-industrial robot systems have long awaited.

    <h4>
        Why is the robot built the way it is?
    </h4>
    <p>Robot vacuums that operate this way navigate a room with greater efficiency, systematically cleaning the floor in a logical pattern. They won't waste time vacuuming areas of a room the robot knows it has already traveled over.</p>

    <h4>
    What effects the robot has on society
    <h4>
    <p>I would say the robot wouldn't be as effective the first time running it, but as the robot continuously ran it got better at cleaning.

        Jobs
    </h5>


<p>I would say that the robots will take the jobs over humans because humans are lazy and want someone else to do it.
